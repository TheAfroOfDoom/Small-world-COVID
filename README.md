# COVID-19 County Visualizer
Jordan Williams, Aidan Tokarski

## Executable
Compile and run with maven, or run the provided executable for convenience. (you should probably use maven)

## Inspiration
Jordan took a small world networks math class during the Fall 2020 semester, and became interested in the idea of modelling COVID-19 using them (SWNs are good to model social networks).

A particularly robust model for social networks can be found in the comments of [this blog post](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2016/09/its-small-world-scale-free-network.html).
