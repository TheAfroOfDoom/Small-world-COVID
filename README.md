# COVID-19 County Visualizer
Jordan Williams, Aidan Tokarski

## How to run
Compile and package the jar with maven: `mvn package`

Then run the jar with `java -jar ./target/cc-1.0.jar`

## Inspiration
Jordan took a small world networks math class during the Fall 2020 semester, and became interested in the idea of modelling COVID-19 using them (SWNs are good to model social networks).

A particularly robust model for social networks can be found in the comments of [this blog post](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2016/09/its-small-world-scale-free-network.html).
